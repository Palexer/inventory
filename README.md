# Inventory

Inventory is a selfhosted web app to keep track of for example items in a warehouse.
It's meant for personal use, but you can obviously use it for whatever you want.

Inventory works by using a CSV file for storing the data and a HTML table as a web interface.
You can sort the table by every column.
